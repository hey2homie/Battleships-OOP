The goal is to sink all ten ships of players opponent. When it's your turn, you can shot a cell. If it was successful, the cell becomes red, and you are allowed to shot once again.  Otherwise, the cell will turn blue. &#10;&#10;Before the actual game, players should enter their names and choose settings: scoring system and timer. They do so by clicking on the corresponding text in the settings menu. When both players are ready, each one of them needs to place ships. You can do that either randomly, or by drag and drop option. Important note: when you are putting ships manually, the beginning of the ship will be at the cursor location. If the vertical orientation is set, then the ship will go down from the cursor, otherwise to the left. Once the ship has been placed, there is no turning back! If you are trying to place a ship, but nothing happens, then it means that it occupies cell, which belong to another ship, which is against the roles. Try another location this time! Also, you can place ships manually after randomly. Just drop any ship to the board&#10;&#10;When the games begin, players see each other opponents board, and nothing more. When making a move, the result will be displayed on the right. It can be Miss, Hit, or, like in real life, Sunk. The game finishes when one of the players has lost all the ships.&#10;&#10;Enjoy!
